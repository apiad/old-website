This blog is a collection of random stuff I like to talk about.
I blog mainly for fun, with the hope that someone finds something
I say useful, or interesting, or somehow helpful. 

I mostly blog about [programming stuff](/blog/programming), from
theoretical things I find interesting, to practical stuff that I just learned.
Some of these posts are tutorial-like, and some are less organized.

Sometimes I also talk about [research](/blog/research),
either my own, or something interesing I discovered or learning recently.
I also like to comment about the current state of affairs in the topics
I do research about.

Finally, sometimes I just [brain-dump whatever is on my head](/blog/rants).
