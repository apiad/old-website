My name is Alejandro Piad. I'm a Computer Scientist from Havana, Cuba. 
I work as instructor (entry-level professor) and researcher at the 
School of Math and Computer Science, University of Havana.

My research interests include machine learning (shallow and deep), 
natural language processing, automatic knowledge discovery,
formal languages and metaheuristics. 
It's kind of a mess but it does let me try different cross-domain ideas.

In my free time I also enjoy coding, playing video games (althought not that much lately),
and writing. I blog about stuff that interests me, just for the fun of sharing it.
This can be anything from cool stuff I found out how to do (read: code), 
interesting research that I've read somewhere, or just random ramblings.
I sometimes blog about pretty technical stuff mainly for students or colleagues
of mine that have very similar interests.
Recently I've been coding a lot in Python, and have a couple 
[FOSS projects on Github](https://github.com/apiad)
that might (or not) be interesting for some. I also blog about these from time to time.

I recently quit Facebook (yeah!) but I'm sometimes online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlejandroPiad), 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/apiad) (though I don't update it very much) and
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/apiad).
