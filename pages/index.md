My name is Alejandro Piad. I'm a Computer Scientist from Havana, Cuba. 
I work as instructor (entry-level professor) and researcher at the 
School of Math and Computer Science, University of Havana.

My research interests include machine learning (shallow and deep), 
natural language processing, automatic knowledge discovery,
formal languages and metaheuristics. 
It's kind of a mess but it does let me try different cross-domain ideas.
