This is a collection of posts about programming stuff.
They are organized in broad categories.

[Tutorials](/programming/tutorials) are more detailed posts about
how to do certain things that I find interesting.
The almost always feature a corresponding [notebook](https://github.com/apiad/apiad.github.io/tree/notebooks).

[Random](/programing/random) stuff is just that, posts about random things that are far less detailed, and sometimes just for the sake of making a point or sharing a fun tool/library/trick.
